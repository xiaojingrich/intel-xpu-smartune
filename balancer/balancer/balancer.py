class LimitedApp:
    """All runtime state for one app currently under a resource limit.

    A single ``LimitRegistry.apps`` entry keyed by the primary effective
    app id (the lexicographically-first cgroup basename).  ``source``
    distinguishes pressure-driven ("auto") from REST/UI ("manual") limits
    so the pressure loop never restores or replaces a manual limit.

    Fields:
      * public_app_id — the public app id (DB primary key) used for
            status updates and SSE callbacks.  For auto limits it may
            equal the cgroup key.
      * limit_rates   — the rate config used when the limit was applied.
      * limit_parts   — {'cpu_mem_limited': bool, 'io_limited': bool}.
      * state         — ``None`` for fully limited, ``"partially_restored"``
            once *any* channel has been partially restored (auto only).
      * partial_parts — {'sys': bool, 'disk_io': bool}: which channel has
            already had its staged (2x) relaxation.  Under the separated
            policy the sys (CPU/memory) and disk-IO channels recover on
            independent timers, so a single ``state`` flag would let the
            first channel to relax block the other one forever; ``state``
            stays as the coarse "has been relaxed at all" signal that the
            PSI-dominant check reads.
      * cgroups       — [primary, *extras]; multi-cgroup apps fan restores
            out across every entry.
      * limit_disks   — disk names the io.max cap was written to, empty for
            "every disk".  Restores must target exactly this set: a partial
            restore writes a real (2x) cap, so replaying it against every disk
            puts a limit on disks that were never throttled.
      * pids          — snapshot of the app's PIDs at limit time, used by
            the reaper to detect that the app has closed (see
            DynamicBalancer._is_app_closed).
      * priority      — the app's configured priority at limit time
            ("undefined" for uncontrolled apps), reported to the UI.
      * is_controlled — True when the app has a DB row.  Decides which
            identity an auto-limit exclusion is keyed by (see
            LimitRegistry.add_exclusion).
      * limit_reason  — which pressure channel triggered the limit:
            "system_pressure" or "disk_pressure".  The combined policy folds
            CPU/memory and disk IO into the single system-pressure signal, so
            everything it limits is reported as "system_pressure".
      * pressure_level — the level of that channel when the limit landed.

                auto must not re-limit an app the user has claimed.  Cleared
                when the manual limit is restored or the app closes.
            Process-lifetime only (never persisted): the semantics are
            "leave it alone for this run of the service".

    ``resource_monitor.get_top_resource_consumers()`` is a multi-second
    CPU+IO+GPU sampling pipeline; running it inline at the moment pressure
    hits ``critical`` would delay throttling by that same duration. This
    class warms the answer asynchronously so the eventual critical-path
    lookup returns immediately.

    Pure cache, no autonomous behavior:
      * Never schedules its own work — every fetch is triggered by an
        explicit ``start(reason)`` call from the caller.
      * Never inspects ``passive_resource_control`` — the caller is
        responsible for skipping ``start()`` when auto-limit is off, so
        that the multi-second sampling never runs without a consumer.

    Allowed triggers from the pressure loop (each gated by the caller):
      1. Rising-edge into ``high``       — ``reason="entering_high"``
      2. Sustained-critical recheck      — ``reason="sustained_critical_recheck"``
      3. Critical-state listener entry   — ``reason="critical_listener"``

    Two independent time constants, easy to confuse:
      * ``CACHE_TTL`` is a *debounce*: it suppresses repeat ``start()`` calls
        fired within seconds of one another (e.g. rising-edge followed by
        listener). It says nothing about whether the data is still valid.
      * ``MAX_CACHE_AGE`` is the *validity* bound used by
        ``resolve_for_critical()``. Past it the cached answer is still returned
        (acting on slightly stale data beats stalling the critical path for a
        multi-second resample) but a background refresh is kicked off, so the
        next tick acts on fresh data. Without this the event-driven refresh
        alone could hand back a minutes-old top list.

    Cold-start fallback: ``resolve_for_critical()`` first returns cached
    data; if empty, waits up to ``CRITICAL_WAIT`` for an in-flight
    prefetch; only then falls back to a synchronous fetch (paying the
    full sampling cost), so the first critical event after boot never
    proceeds without top-consumer info.

    Thread-safety: ``_lock`` guards the cache dict; ``_inflight`` is a
    one-shot gate that prevents fetch storms when multiple triggers race.

        Walks the candidates in descending-IO order and selects the first that is:
          1. not a Critical app -- Critical apps are never throttled for disk IO, so a
             Critical #1 consumer is skipped and the next candidate is considered;
          2. not already under an auto disk-IO limit -- so successive critical ticks move
             on to the *next* heavy consumer (limit the 2nd, then the 3rd, ...) instead of
             re-limiting the same app;
          3. itself doing enough disk IO for a cap to matter -- see
             :meth:`_qualifies_for_throttle`, which judges each disk the app touches
             against that disk's media floor. Bandwidth alone is not a sufficient test: a
             4k random workload is bandwidth-light but IOPS-heavy, and capping it *does*
             relieve the device.

        Controlled non-critical apps are capped at their own priority's rates; uncontrolled
        apps count as ``undefined`` (lowest tier), i.e. a heavy unmanaged writer is
        throttled harder than a managed Low app.  The candidate's own sampled IO rate is
        used as the gate (no extra per-app sampling).

        A controlled app's cgroup set is resolved the same way the CPU/memory critical path
        does it (:meth:`_resolve_controlled_target`): the top-consumer sample keys an app by
        a single cgroup, and for ``process_names`` apps by a public app id that need not be
        a systemd unit at all -- without resolving, ``set_disk_io_throttle`` cannot find an
        ``io.max`` to write and the limit silently never lands.

        :return: ``(should_adjust, is_controlled, app_id, limit_rates, target_app, index)``
            where ``index`` is the candidate's position in *top_consumers* so the caller can
            drop exactly the entry that was acted on.  When nothing is worth limiting --
            every candidate is Critical, already limited, or below threshold -- returns
            ``(False, False, None, None, None, None)`` even under critical pressure: there
            is simply no useful throttle left to apply.

        ``source: auto -> manual`` and is added to the exclusion list (exactly what
        :meth:`lock_to_manual` does). So the app lands as a single MANUAL_LIMITED managed
        row with Limit/Restore/Edit already unlocked -- the operator does *not* need a
        second Lock to Manual click, and the pressure loop never re-grabs it. The cgroup
        caps are carried over untouched, so there is no release / crash window.
        (This supersedes the earlier "entry stays source=auto" design.)

        :returns: ``(ok, message)`` -- *message* names the failure for the REST layer.
